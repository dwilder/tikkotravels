				<h2>How can I share my Tikko story with you?</h2>
				
				<p>You can share your Tikko stories with us using our Facebook page at <a href="http://facebook.com/tikktravels">facebook.com/tikkotravels</a>, by messaging us on Twitter using our Twitter name <a href="twitter.com/tikktravels">@tikkotravels</a>, or by sending us an email at <a href="mailto:info@tikkotravels.org">info@tikkotravels.org</a>. If you have a photo or video that accompanies your story, you can link to it or include it in the message.</p>
				
				<h2>Will you share my Tikko story on your website?</h2>
				
				<p>We will do our best to share your story. Please keep in mind that we may not be able to share everyone's story. We are more likely to post it if your story is fun, and if you have a good photograph of Tikko doing something unique. Bonus points if your story is related to Autism or children's brain health.</p>
				
				<h2>Will you include my name with my story?</h2>
				
				<p>You can choose whether or not your name is included with your Tikko story. When you submit your story, please let us know if you would like to remain anonymous and we will post the story from "Friends of Tikko".</p>
				
				<h2>Where can I learn more about Autism?</h2>
				
				<p>If you would llike to learn more about Autism, please see our <a href="autism-awareness.php">Autism Awareness</a> articles.</p>
				
				<h2>Where can I find resources or assistance for Autism?</h2>
				
				<p>Unfortunately, there is currently no cohesive strategy for managing Autism. You best chances of finding help are to ask your family doctor. Don't forget to search online for resources in your area.</p>
