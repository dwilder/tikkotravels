			<div class="article-summary">
				<p>Research into the Autism covers a broad range, both into the causes, therapies and treatments for symptoms, and ultimately the cure for Autism. There have been many exciting findings, and the search continues.</p>

				<h2>Building a Better Understanding of Autism</h2>
				
				<h3>Looking for a Cause</h3>
				
				<p>Although the causes of Autism are not known, there is significant research into a number of areas. There is active research looking for the cause of Autism in genetics, environmental factors, viruses and bacteria, neurology, immunology, and oxidative stress. Any one, or some combination of these factors may be the cause of Autism.</p>
				
				<h3>Researching Treatments</h3>
				
				<p>The range of treatment options is currently limited and inconclusive. Options include biomedical and nutritional pathways, as well as detoxification.</p>
				
				<h3>Diagnosing Autism</h3>
				
				<p>There is ongoing research into developing medical tests for early detection and early intervention.</p>
				
				<h2>Exciting Findings</h2>
				
				<p>Research into Autism has yielded promising results in many areas. In particular, genetic research has discovered 19 genetic markers for Autism, and research into environmental causes has found key environmental mechanisms. Environmental factors such as chemicals, infectious agents, or physiological or psychological stress have been linked to the onset of Autism.</p>
				
				<p>In the treatment of Autism, researchers have seen success with:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Diet management: with a Gluten free-Casein Free (GFCF) diet, 69% saw improvements in behaviors and gastrointestinal disorders</li>
					<li>Vitamin supplementation</li>
					<li>Identification and removal of food allergies and environmental allergies</li>
					<li>Sensory and Music therapies</li>
					<li>Intensive behavioral therapies and methods, such as floor time and playtime</li>
					<li>Equine therapies</li>
					<li>Communication therapies, like sign language</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h2>Therapies and Interventions</h2>
				
				<p>Many treatments and interventions are possible with ASD and have shown significant progress on a case-by-case basis. These include educational, environmental, nutritional, and medical. Each individual is different and therefore must identify the key symptoms for alleviation. Intensive behaviour therapies have been shown to be very effective as have vitamin, nutrition and diet interventions.</p>
				<p>As each child is an individual this is a very labour and time intensive as well as costly process to identify applicable therapies and interventions at each stage of a childâ€™s life and development.</p>
