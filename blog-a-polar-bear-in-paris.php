				<p>If you’re following Tikko’s travels, which we hope you are, this story follows Tikko’s previous trip to Shoreham by the Sea.</p>

				<p>After boarding his plane to Paris, Tikko met the Air Transat’s pilot, co-pilot and flight crew. Tikko sat at the controls wishing he could fly the plane. Silly non-opposable paws!</p>

				<p>Lucy Godinho and Darla Malcolm-Hauraney understand Tikko’s wish and the importance of his travelling.</p>

				<blockquote>Tikko is spreading the word to people of all ages that it is OK to be different; that it’s important to love and appreciate everyone's uniqueness. Tikko opens up a conversation during all his travels; to breakdown stereotypes.</blockquote>

				<p>Landing in Paris, Tikko is excited to explore the local shops. A local cheesemonger displayed an exciting selection of gourmet delights from all over France. Tikko was surprised to learn cheeses age in a “ripening cave”. Tikko thought only bears lived in caves. Surrounded by cheese, Tikko was in heaven! Of course, polar bears don’t actually eat cheese, but they do admire craftsmanship!</p>

				<p>At the next shop, Tikko considered buying an “I love Paris” sign. So far, he really did love Paris.</p>

				<p>Tikko marvelled at the many amazing exhibits at the Louvre, one of the world's largest museums and a historic monument! Tikko’s most favourite place was The Eiffel Tower! The view was spectacular! Standing tall at 1,052 feet, The Eiffel Tower, at night, lit with twinkling strobe lights, was the highlight of Tikko’s trip!</p>

				<p>Considered “star children” by some, autistic children have their own way of brightly twinkling. Lucy Godinho sees this in her students every day. Teaching children on the spectrum makes her an advocate for autism; and for Tikko.</p>

				<blockquote>There is hope to change people's perspectives on Autism. People with Autism can learn; be independent.  They have talents. Tikko teaches people to be patient and open their minds and hearts. Tikko helps people to step outside of their box and comfort zone.</blockquote>

				<p>In agreement, Tikko gives Lucy an appreciative kiss goodnight after a long day of exploring.</p>

				<blockquote>Tikko helped us create fun memories, meet local people, strike up conversations with other travellers from lots of other countries on our tours.  Our hope is to visit Italy and Greece next. We would love to bring Tikko along again!</blockquote>
