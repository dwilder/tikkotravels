				<p>Tikko is a travelling polar bear and best friend of Dorian, a young boy with Autism.  Dorian really wanted to travel and explore different places, but he could not. So Tikko did it for him. Tikko helped Dorian experience the world by travelling and having new adventures, with some help from family and friends. After seeing Tikko’s adventures through pictures, Dorian found the courage to take his first trip ever!</p>

				<blockquote>I started travelling to help my friend Dorian. Dorian has Autism and he was afraid to travel. After a year of seeing my adventures and reliving my trips with me, Dorian had the courage to make his first trip ever! Of course I went with him and his family too! We had a really great time. You can see photos of my adventure in my <a href="blog.php">Tikko Blog</a>.  Thanks to new friends like you, we can help other kids with Autism by travelling and sharing our adventures for everyone to see!</blockquote>
