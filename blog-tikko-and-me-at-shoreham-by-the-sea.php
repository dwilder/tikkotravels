				<p>En-route to Europe and no stranger to flying, Tikko buckled up for safety. Surprising nearby passengers, Tikko found his own seat by the window. Travelling with friends is always fun! Tikko’s companions, Darla Malcom-Hauraney and Lucy Godinho, looked forward to their time together.</p>

				<blockquote>We were inspired by the news story on CTV about Tikko. The story of how Dorian could take on such an amazing challenge to bring awareness of Autism and how being different is OK.</blockquote>

				<p>Tikko joined Darla’s first ever family vacation overseas to Paris, France, London, England, and Shoreham By Sea. Arriving in London, England, Tikko couldn’t wait to visit Buckingham Palace! Outside the palace walls Tikko stared down a guard…and won! Wearing the guard’s hat was Tikko’s idea!</p>

				<p>Tikko was surprised to learn that “Changing the Guard” was a top attraction in London. Posing in front of the coronation carriage, Tikko imagined what it would be like to be crowned “King Tikko”.</p>

				<p>A lovely, afternoon tea at Kensington Palace followed.  When Tikko heard London Bridge was falling down, he rushed over to save it.  Silly courageous bear!</p>

				<p>It was grand meeting the local Londoners on the London Eye; and during “high tea” at the Orangery (Tikko was on his best behaviour); the local fish and chip shop, and Shoreham by the Sea.</p>

				<p>Shoreham by the Sea is a small seaside town and port in West Sussex, England. Tikko was fascinated by the large collection of houseboats made from converted tugs, barges, and mine sweepers. Tikko enjoyed visiting the many shops in the area, but most of all the people. As Darla soon discovered, Tikko makes friends wherever he goes!</p>

				<blockquote>Everyone we introduced Tikko to was happy to meet such a well-travelled, mannered bear. They all had questions about his journey.  We were happy to spread Autism awareness!</blockquote>

				<p>At Westhove Infant School in Brighton, England, Tikko had the pleasure of meeting 600 students, ages 4-7 years. Lucy, a Peel School Board teacher who educates children with Autism on a daily basis, presented Tikko as part of her presentation about Canada.  Having many questions about Tikko, and understanding Tikko’s message, the students voiced their opinion around everyone being special in their own school. Many of the school children live with Autism.</p>

				<blockquote>It was wonderful to see these children make an instant connection with Tikko!</blockquote>

				<p>After packing, Darla, Lucy and Tikko met a Bobby outside their hotel.  Tikko promised to be a good little polar bear wherever he goes. Waving “Cheerio” to London, the three set off on a new adventure.</p>

				<p>Next stop PARIS!</p>
