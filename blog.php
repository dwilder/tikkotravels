				<p>Travelling to Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, Matteo and Tikko soon discovered autism was an unfamiliar topic of discussion.  Area locals responded with surprise, saying, "I've heard of autism; we have few cases here."  It's possibly true as research showed autism support groups in Punta Cana to be non-existent.  One might wonder, are there no cases, or no diagnoses?</p>
