				<h2>The Cause</h2>
				<p>The Tikko Charitable Foundation is raising funds to build awareness and support services for Autism and Children`s Brain health. Donors choose the specific organization where they would like the Tikko Charitable Foundation to allocate the donations they have raised.</p>
				
				<h2>The Event</h2>
				<p>The Givegolf for Brain Health event will be held across Canada, except Quebec, from July 1 to July 31, 2014. We encourage family and friends of players to sponsor them, either per hole or as a flat donation. Each person who donates to a family member, friend, colleague, or golf buddy, will receive a tax receipt (for a donation over $25) as well as valuable coupons. We refer to our donors as 'the Gallery'.</p>
				
				<h2>The Game</h2>
				<p>The game itself will be based on playing 100 holes of golf during the month of July. The golfer who raises the most $$$ is the Champion. The player who plays the most holes in the month (with a minimum of $1800 raised) will receive a special prize pack. All participants who raise at least $500 ($5 per hole) will receive valuable coupons and prizes. Participants will continue to receive prizes as they hit other prize levels $1000, $2500, $5000, and $10,000. Participants will be able to see the leaderboard of names online at the Givegolf.ca site.</p>
