				<h2>We Love Kids</h2>
				
				<p>The Tikko Charitable Foundation is concerned with the welfare of children with Autism and Brain Health issues. Not every family is able to support a child who's needs are unique, a child who may not be able to succeed in the way that other children can. We know that these children need extra attention, that they often need to learn one-on-one, and that their care makes it difficult for their families to lead a normal life. And we want to help.</p>
				
				<h2>Charitable Events</h2>

				<p>We like to come up with fun ways to fundraise, including <a href="http://swignforetheanswers.com">Swing For the Answers</a>, where we ask golfers to sponsor other golfers doing something they love, and helping kids along the way.</p>
				
				<p>Not every event is about raising money. With photo contests and online events, we love to harness new technologies to host virtual events to raise awareness for Autism and children's Brain Health. With 1 in 88 children affected by Autism word-wide, we know there is a lot to be done, and we're going to need a lot of help.</p>
				
				<h2>Tikko and Donations</h2>
				
				<p>Funds raised from the sale of Travelling Tikko&#8482; and donations to the Tikko Charitable Foundation are use to fund our awareness campaign for Autism and children's Brain Health. A portion of our funds are distributed to charitable organizations that provide education and support services, special needs facilities and conduct research about Autism and children's Brain Health, including Autism Speaks.</p>
