				<p>My name is Tikko!<br />
				I love to travel to fun places to help children with Autism. Did you know that there are millions of children around the world that have Autism? That’s a lot of kids!! Children with Autism have a really hard time being in new places and trying new things. Most people don’t know much about Autism and when they meet someone with Autism, they may not know what to say to them.</p>
				
				<p>I started travelling to help my friend Dorian. Dorian has Autism and he was afraid to travel. After a year of seeing my adventures and reliving my trips with me, Dorian had the courage to make his first trip ever! Of course I went with him and his family too! We had a really great time. You can see photos of my adventure at <a href="http://tikkotravels.org">www.tikkotravels.org</a>.  Thanks to new friends like you, we can help other kids with Autism by travelling and sharing our adventures for everyone to see!</p>

				<p>Thank you for buying me! You have helped pay for research, awareness and education for kids with Autism and other children’s brain health issues. If you would like to do even more to help children with Autism and their families, please take me with you when you go to fun places like parks, parties and family trips! Then, take photos, videos and Vines of me at the places that you visit! Ask your parents or guardian for permission to post them on my website at <a href="http://tikkotravels.org">www.tikkotravels.org</a>. Your parent or guardian could also post my adventures on my Facebook page (<a href="http://facebook.com/tikkotravels">facebook.com/tikkotravels</a>), Instagram (<a href="http://instagram.com/tikkotravels">instagram.com/tikkotravels</a>) or on my Twitter account (<a href="http://twitter.com/tikkotravels">twitter.com/tikkotravels</a>).</p>
