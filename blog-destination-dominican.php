				<p>Travelling to Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, Matteo and Tikko soon discovered autism was an unfamiliar topic of discussion. Area locals responded with surprise, saying, "I've heard of autism; we have few cases here." It's possibly true as research showed autism support groups in Punta Cana to be non-existent. One might wonder, are there no cases, or no diagnoses?</p>

				<p>Ten year old Matteo Statti loves video games, television; anything equipped with a screen.  Matteo doesn't love Aspergers, yet he's come to accept the diagnosis; embracing life on the spectrum.</p>
				
				<p>You may ask, what do a 10 year old aspie and an autistic polar bear have in common? Both are inspiring, challenging, evolving, engaging... and most certainly, endearing. More importantly, Matteo and Tikko love to travel! Together, whether on foot, by boat or plane, they experience all the wonders of the world!</p>

				<p>Matteo’s mom Kitsa Statti loved the idea of a polar bear who advocates for autism!</p>
				
				<blockquote>It’s amazingly awesome how such a small furry stuffy can generate interest and conversation with others! Tikko gives Matteo the courage to speak up about Aspergers. Matteo enjoys the attention; and loves feeling he’s making a difference! Tikko gives us hope the world will see autism the way we do. It’s okay to be different!</blockquote>
				
				<p>Travelling to Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, Tikko and Matteo made lots of new friends along the way.  Soon discovering autism was an unfamiliar topic of discussion, Matteo shared his personal experience with others. Kitsa, recalling a time when Matteo was embarrassed about his diagnosis, attributes Tikko to Matteo’s transformation.</p>

				<p>Thrilled to have Tikko by his side, Matteo is proud of himself.  Aspergers doesn’t define who he is!</p>

				<p>Feeling invigorated, Matteo, jumps and swims in the ocean, keeping a mindful eye on Tikko who suns himself on the beach. After a busy day, it’s time for play!</p>

				<p>Sand and ocean breezes behind them, Tikko and Matteo look forward to their next trip together. Soon departing for sunny Cancun, Matteo & Tikko anticipate swimming with dolphins, zip-lining or an equally daring adventure!</p>

				<p>After that, who knows? Life is about balance; overcoming challenges and finding your path.  One thing is certain, with Tikko by his side, Matteo is going to enjoy the journey… one step (and paw print) at a time!</p>
