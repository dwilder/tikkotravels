				<h2>Early Diagnosis is Critical</h2>
				
				<p>The earlier a child is diagnosed with Autism (ASD), the better the chances are for their functional development. Children often show definitive signs as early as 12-24 months. These signs might include:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Language: Either no development or initial development and then loss of progress</li>
					<li>Response to Sound: often don’t respond and may appear deaf</li>
					<li>Tantrums: Difficulties consoling oneself</li>
					<li>Sleeping: waking at night or restless sleep</li>
					<li>Bonding: Indifference to people and parents</li>
					<li>Hand eye connection: doesn’t “point and look”</li>
					<li>Self restricted/selected diet</li>
					<li>Play: limited self play or with other children</li>
					<li>Chronic gastrointestinal problems</li>
					<li>Poor immune system: prone to infections</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h2>Typical Challenges</h2>
				
				<p>Autism impacts a child in three main areas: physically, mentally, and socially. Physically, a child with Autism may have a immune system irregularities, nutritional deficiencies, and gastrointestinal problems.</p>
				
				<p>A child with Autism is likely to develop behaviour problems, may have abnormal responses to sensory stimulation, and difficulties sleeping, toileting and eating. Communication and language skills may not develop, or may be slow to develop, along with underdeveloped intellectual functioning.</p>
				
				<p>Although children may have a difficult time forming friendships, or even being with other people, a strong routine can help them cope.</p>
