				<p>Named Noah, it’s no surprise this special three year old loves animals; especially fluffy white polar bears! Noah Anthonisen of Minnesota lives with autism. Tanya Anthonisen, Noah’s mom, was excited to hear Tikko likes to travel.</p>

				<blockquote>Noah receives special services at school for speech and occupational therapy. When I first heard about Tikko, I knew in my heart Noah would love a new friend; one he could talk to; who could help Noah out with car trips. Noah experiences a lot of anxiety on road trips. For Father’s Day we planned a trip to visit my dad in Oklahoma. Naturally we had concerns over Noah enduring such a long a trip. It’s a 12-hour journey.</blockquote>

				<p>When planning anything new or changing activities for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder, advance warning is absolutely vital in ensuring a smooth transition for successful results.</p>

				<p>As Tikko travelled to Minnesota, Tanya prepared Noah for Tikko’s arrival.</p>

				<blockquote>We frequently talked to Noah about Tikko coming to see us.  From Noah’s reaction, I knew during our trip to Oklahoma, Noah would feel comforted by Tikko. When Tikko arrived, Noah was so happy to see him!  Grabbing Tikko, Noah picked him up and hugged him really tight! Dressing Tikko in the outfits he arrived with, Noah cooed, ‘I love you Tikko’ and gave the bear kisses. We took lots of photos of the two of them together.</blockquote>

				<p>As Noah and Tikko travelled to Oklahoma, Noah, knowing the importance of advanced warnings, prepared Tikko for their arrival. When stopping to grab a bite to eat, the Anthonisens met another family along the way.  Everybody seemed curious about Tikko. Tikko gave Noah the courage to speak up and introduce his new travel buddy.</p>

				<p>Reaching their destination, Noah couldn’t wait to introduce his “new best friend Tikko” to “Grandma and Grandpa”.</p>

				<p>At the Oklahoma City Zoo, Tikko, who brought along some pocket money, bought Noah a lovely stuffed hippo. Tikko knew when it was time to leave, Noah would miss him terribly. So Tikko gave Noah a new friend to play with. Yet in the end, Tikko realized Noah found a special place in his heart… and Tikko decided to stay. Now, their adventures together are just beginning!</p>

				<blockquote>Tikko is my son’s best friend. Tikko gives Noah the courage to step out and explore. Noah, knowing he can talk things over with Tikko finds it easier to try new activities. Noah loves Tikko. Believing Tikko loves him; Noah feels safe in sharing his deepest secrets; content to travel with his new companion. Together they are planning to visit Wisconsin Dells’ water park for Noah’s 4th birthday in February. Whenever Tikko’s left behind in the car, Noah assures him, ‘Mom will come back soon.’ When in church, Noah folds Tikko’s paws, asking him to pray.</blockquote>

				<p>What is that little polar bear praying for? No doubt many more adventures with his new best friend!</p>
