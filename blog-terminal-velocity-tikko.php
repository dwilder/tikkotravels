				<p>Sunburst above; calm air creates the perfect day for “Pass the Polar Bear”. Being Tikko’s very first skydive, we can only imagine what is going through his mind while viewing the earth below.</p>

				<blockquote>Wow, that’s a REALLY big drop!</blockquote>

				<blockquote>My fur’s holding out; glad I have my goggles and flight jacket.</blockquote>

				<blockquote>Wait a minute, where’s my parachute?!!!!</blockquote>

				<p>Facing a possible plunge, Tikko remains courageous (as always); passing from one skydiver to the next, with a few stolen bear kisses along the way!</p>

				<p>Securely held by Felipe Lavalle, Tikko’s heart leaps with joy when seeing a beautiful red and white parachute open above, as the two glide safely through the sky.</p>

				<blockquote>I GOT YA BUDDY!</blockquote>

				<p>Revelling in the adrenaline-charged feeling from facing one’s fears, Felipe’s reassurance is all Tikko needs!</p>

				<p>A unique perspective, Tikko views the various shades of the earth’s patchwork quilt below. Mesmerized by its beauty, Tikko forgets he is now 2,000 feet above ground.</p>

				<p>Manipulating toggles on the end of the parachute’s steering lines, Felipe controls their speed and direction. A seasoned jumper, Felipe ensures a safe landing!</p>

				<p>(Gravity Gives Project) Founder Greg Nelson acknowledges that the extreme sports community is getting increased exposure for delivering a message to the general population.</p>

				<blockquote>Historically, traditional fundraising and awareness efforts have relied upon mainstream methods. In the age of social media, sometimes the more daring and out of the ordinary can be more valuable to an organization wishing to promote their cause. Tikko is an excellent example of how something simple can be built into a large and engaging effort with little preparation or overhead cost.</blockquote>
