				<h1>What is Autism?</h1>

				<p>According to Autism Speaks, Autism is a complex disorder that affects brain development, social skills, all forms of communication and behaviour. There are varying degrees and each case is unique. The Autism Spectrum incorporates all degrees of Autism.</p>

				<h2>Facts About Autism</h2>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Autism affects 1 in 88 children in North America, 1 in 54 boys</li>
					<li>Autism costs a family $60,000 a year on average</li>
					<li>Fastest growing developmental disability in the US, rising 57% between 2002 and 2006</li>
					<li>More prevalent in children than AIDS, Diabetes and Cancer combined</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>For someone born in 2000, a U.S. study estimated an average discounted lifetime cost of $4.01 million (2013 dollars, inflation-adjusted from 2003  estimate), with about 10%medical care, 30% extra education and other care, and 60% lost economic productivity.</p>
				
				<p>A UK study estimated discounted lifetime costs at ₤1.51 million and ₤975 thousand for an autistic person with and without intellectual disability, respectively (2013 pounds, inflation-adjusted from 2005/06 estimate).</p>
				
				<h2>Looking Forward</h2>
				
				<p>Right now, there is no cure. The best remedies are particular approaches to teaching and therapies to develop social skills and behaviour. Each case is unique and requires a trained professional to assist the individual in advancing their skills and to overcome daily obstacles.</p>
